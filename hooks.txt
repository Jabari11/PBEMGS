The Curious Tester Hook:

📨 Looking for play-by-email game testers!
I’ve built a new system for async, email-based games—starting with an original take on Tic-Tac-Toe (Ninetac) and Ataxx. No installs, no logins—just send an email to start playing.
Want to help me test? Send an email to pbemgs@angryturtlestudios.com with the subject help to see how it works!

The Nostalgia Hook (for async gamers):

💌 Remember Play-by-Mail games? Now you can play async strategy games by email—no accounts, no hassle.
The system is fully working and needs testers! Play Ninetac (a deep twist on Tic-Tac-Toe) or Ataxx with friends at your own pace.

The Unique Concept Hook (for game dev/gamer discords):

🛠️ I built a fully working Play-By-Email game server!
You send commands by email, the system runs the game, and updates get emailed back to you. Starting with Ninetac (a new strategy game) and Ataxx.
Looking for people to help test & break it! Just email pbemgs@angryturtlestudios.com with info in the subject and see what happens!
