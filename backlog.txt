Game idea backlog:

- GoMoku (next)
- Skirmish For Earth (card/bidding)

Order below TBD:

- PvE RPG - like Slay the Spire, leaderboards, etc.
  - Flex-Class??  (i.e. ALL talent trees are open, combine how you like?)
  - stamina (actions per day), 1 char per user
  - Estiah-style combat (char actions = card deck, randomized)
  - extra units, groups of enemies.  Allows AoE, buffing, etc.

- MOBA.  Same card combat mechanics, ticks like Surge.
  - Each unit (inc trash/neutral/bases (?)) has its own deck, allows unit upgrades (new to MOBAs?)
  - Otherwise, similar to normal MOBAs.  Want to avoid LoL-style "carries" though - use HotS levelling?

- Military Catan:
  - Catan map/resource collection, build armies as well as cities.
  - WW2-tier units, no air other than choppers?
  - Die-roll based combat, probably.

- Quantis:
  - 1v1 Archon-like.  Units are quantum particles.
  - TGC-like (with set decks).  Can build on the board (walls, conveyors, turrets)
  - Card or dice combat here, not sure.

- Space 4X:
  - Dig up my old design - 4x4 (5x5?) grid of planets (or space) with varying edge capacities (wormhole-distances).
  - Rough design similar to MOO2 - planets can have a starbase, ground defenses, etc.  Produce materials to build.
  - Similar ship types to MOO2 as well.

- Some kind of sports game?  Club manager or tactical (like Blood Bowl), or both?

- Capture the flag (look at BannerCatch)

- Kingdom Sim

- Netstorm++
